# Net_Worth_Calculator
This is an application to calculate net worth, assets and liabilities. For this application, I have used JavaScript framework (React) in frontend UI and Node.js with Express to handle RESTFul API requests.

## Here is the Architecture Diagram of the application

## Run React Client 

Clone the project, change into the client directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
https://github.com/Saima-Chaity/Net_Worth_Calculator.git
cd Net_Worth_Calculator/client
npm install
```
Run the React application using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

## Run Node Server

In another terminal, change into the server directory and install the dependencies.

```bash
cd Net_Worth_Calculator/server
npm install
```
Run the Node server using the following command:

```bash
nodemon start
```

Run the unit test using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Feature Improvements
- Keep a database to store data and support multiple users
- Configure deployement pipeline and make it global
- Add unit test in Frontend React client
